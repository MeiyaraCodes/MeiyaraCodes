I'm a creative multi-hobbyist who dived into tech and digital stuff. My interests revolve around psychology, problem-solving, writing, music, and hiking. I am using the power of the digital workspace to capture my travels, hikes, and artistic crafts. I have an art blogsite <a href="https://meiyara.art.blog/">Meiyara Manawari</a>.
